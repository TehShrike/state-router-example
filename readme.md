Information about the [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), and some example implementations.

**[Check it out!](http://tehshrike.github.io/state-router-example)**

To run it yourself locally, check it out into some directory being served up by a static http server, maybe Apache or something:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:TehShrike/state-router-example.git
cd state-router-example
npm install
```

At this point you can `npm run build` to build a deployable version of all three versions, minified and everything, or you can run one of these if you want to play with the code:

- `npm run watchriot`
- `npm run watchractive`
- `npm run watchvirtualdom`
